# THIS FILE IS EXECUTED, AND IT IS BASH — not POSIX sh, and not zsh. The
# shebang above is honoured by `./this`; `sh this` and `zsh this` IGNORE it,
# and neither of them fails where the mistake was made. Measured on this tree:
#
#   zsh scripts/queue_cited.sh   exit 2 blaming the TREE ("this is not a
#                                checkout root") for zsh's word-splitting
#   zsh scripts/kill_mine.sh     an ordinary-looking census of nothing
#   sh  scripts/sweep.sh         "lifecycle.sh: line 152: syntax error"
#
# A wrong shell here does not crash. It ANSWERS, and the answer looks like the
# tree's fault.
#
# TWO TESTS, because on macOS `/bin/sh` IS bash: BASH_VERSION is set under
# `sh x.sh` and only POSIX MODE tells the two apart (SHELLOPTS carries
# `posix`). On Linux `/bin/sh` is dash and the first test is the one that
# fires. Neither test alone covers both machines.
#
# A SOURCED library must never carry this. There the interpreter is the
# caller's ON PURPOSE and an `exit` would kill the caller's shell — the
# argument is scripts/db.sh's, at scripts/db.sh:50-57, and it is why db.sh is
# the one executable in this tree deliberately without a belt.
